# Scala Playground
>Exercises from `"Functional Programming in Scala"` MEAP 
and other Scala stuff

_Here will be all my exercises `solutions` for the tasks from this 
great **red book**. 
Also here could be some other interesting Scala things 
and my strange `experiments`._

>There are two `root packages: com.meap and com.gelo` for book exercises and my experiments respectively.

>Each chapter has its own `package`

>`Example usages of task objects are in runners` that exist for every logical structure of elements and you can run them in main.

>Throughout the sources i will comment out `main things and interesting facts`

>You are free to `suggest better solutions` that i will leave in sources as comments or replace my own implementation
